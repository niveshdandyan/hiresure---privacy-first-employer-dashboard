# HireSure - Privacy-First Employer Dashboard

Welcome to **HireSure**, a smart dashboard designed to help employers find domestic helpers efficiently while protecting privacy. We use AI to help you search naturally and a special privacy system to keep everyone safe.

## Two-Tier Privacy Architecture

We designed HireSure to balance two needs: Employers need to see candidate details to hire, but Helpers need to be protected from unwanted calls and data misuse.

We solve this with a **Two-Tier System**:

### Tier 1 - Public Discovery (Safe Searching)
This is the "Search Mode" open to everyone.
*   **What you see:** Experience, verified skills (like "Elderly Care" or "Cooking"), ratings, and the agency name.
*   **What is HIDDEN:** The helper's real name, phone number, address, and ID documents.
*   **Why:** This lets you find the right person based on their skills and reputation, without exposing their private data to the whole internet.

### Tier 2 - Approved Sharing (Full Access)
This is for when you are ready to hire.
1.  **Request Access:** When you find a good match, you click "Request Full Profile".
2.  **Helper Approval:** The helper gets a notification on their phone: *"The Lee family wants to view your complete profile. Do you approve?"*
3.  **Reveal:** Only if the helper says **YES**, you will see their full contact details and real name.

**This puts the helper in control.** They decide who gets to see their private information.
