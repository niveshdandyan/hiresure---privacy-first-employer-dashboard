HireSure  Privacy-First Employer Dashboard

HireSure is a smart dashboard that helps employers find domestic helpers in an easy and safe way. It uses AI for natural searching and has a strong privacy system that protects every user's personal data.

Two-Tier Privacy System

HireSure balances two needs: employers must see the details of a helper before hiring, and helpers must be protected from unwanted contact or misuse of their data.
To solve this, HireSure uses a two-tier privacy system.

Tier 1  Public Discovery (Safe Search)

This is the basic search mode open to everyone.
What you can see: experience, verified skills such as elderly care or cooking, ratings, and the agency name.
What you cannot see: the helpers real name, phone number, address, or ID documents.
Reason: this allows employers to search based on skills and history while keeping all private information hidden from the public.

Tier 2  Approved Sharing (Full Access)

This mode is used when an employer is ready to hire.
Step 1: The employer sends a request to view the full profile.
Step 2: The helper receives a message on their phone asking if they want to share their full details with that employer.
Step 3: The full profile is shown only if the helper agrees.

This keeps the helper in control. They choose who can see their private information.
